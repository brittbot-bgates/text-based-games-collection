# Text-Based Games Collection
A collection of text-based games you can play in the command prompt/terminal.
## About The Project
I wanted to create some text-based games using Python people can play in the consoles.

This also gives me the chance to solidify using various techniques like receiving standard input, using logic, and handling exceptions.
## Games
